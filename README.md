# Azure Voting App (Rust & PostgreSQL)

This is a re-implementation of the [Azure Voting App (Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis) project in Rust with PostgreSQL.

There are a few features added to allow the demonstration of some of the basic capabilities of Kubernetes for application hosting.

See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for deployment instructions.
